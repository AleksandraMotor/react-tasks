# React Tasks

This project contains [Live view](https://github.com/AleksandraMotor/react-tasks) at typical recruitment tasks and solutions that I have encountered during my journey.


## How to use 
In the [react-tasks/src/components](https://github.com/AleksandraMotor/react-tasks/tree/master/src/components) you will find folders with different tasks. In these folders, beside components content, you will find an instructions file containing all information you would be given on an interview, when asked to solve react related task.

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
